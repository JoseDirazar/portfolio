        After studying 4 years {" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Accounting at UNICEN</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming and enroll in a coding bootcamp learning the current trends on the market to develop {" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full stack Apps</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem and learn more every day. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Express, Sequelize and SQL
        </span>. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma, and
         always looking to learn new technologies like: Nest.js, Bun, Astro, MongoDB. Currently I&apos;m looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.

      <p>
